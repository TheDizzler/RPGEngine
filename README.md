# RPGEngine
A custom RPG engine using DirectXTK in C++ and story creation tool (MakerEngine) in C#.

This repo contains two projects: An RPG engine (root directory) in C++ and a story creation tool (/MakerEngine) in C#.
The creation tool edits XML files that are parsed by the RPG engine.

## Done:
> RPG Engine
>- Parse and display text from XML
>- Prompt player with a pop-up question box and dialog flows to proper reply
>- Prompt player for alphanumeric input (name input) and save input
>
> Story Creator
>- Parse and display game text
>- Create new dialog "blocks" and save to XML file

## To Do Next:
> RPG Engine
>- update parser to read changes made to xml structure
>- parse and display maps
>
> Story Creator
>- Create, edit and save full dialog flow
>- Map creation and linking to game text (npc chatting, triggered events, etc)


## To Do later:
> RPG Engine
>- map/town screen and transitions
>- battle screen
>
> Story Creator
>- User testing
